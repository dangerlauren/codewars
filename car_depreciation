// You own a great car website that helps people make decisions about buying the best new car for them. You decide that if you had a calculator on the website which lets people know their car's value after depreciation in a couple of years, would be a great idea!

// Write a function that takes the car's value when new (p) and return its value to 2 decimal places in the nth year (n).

// Yearly depreciation: Year 1 = 20% Year 2 = 20% Year 3+ = 10% per year (ie. after 3 years the cars value depreciates 10% every year)


function car(p,n){
  if (n < 2) {
    return (p*0.8).toFixed(2);
  }
  else if (n < 3) {
    return ((p*0.8)*0.8).toFixed(2);
  }
  else {
    return (((p*0.8)*0.8)*0.9).toFixed(2);
  }
}

// SOLUTION

function car(p,n){
if (n == 0) {return p.toFixed(2);}
  p = p - p*(n > 2 ? 0.1 : 0.2);
  n--;
  return car(p,n);
}
